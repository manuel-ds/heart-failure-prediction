Analysing a dataset with 300 patients, I tried to classify whether a person had an heart attack. For each patients we have data about the person charateristics such as age and sex, but also the symptoms signed when once arrived at the hospital. 

The project is structured in this way:

- import data and exploration
- data pre-processing and data cleaning
- exploratory data analysis 
- model training, tuning and evaluation
- model comparison
